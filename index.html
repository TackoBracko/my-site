            <p class="me-para1">Hi, my name is Tatjana and I'm future web developer</p>
            <p>I started this journey a year ago by quitting my old job as a kindergarten teacher to change my future.
            <abbr title="just kidding :)">They told me that there is no big difference between kids and clients so let's try this.</abbr></p>
            <p>I enjoy working, being outdoors and drinking coffee, so this is a great combination.
                I'm making sam nice things with my knowledge of HTML and CSS and adding JavaScript to it. 
                This place is little part of me where I'll write about my projects, things I'm currently working on and learning. And this is just the beginning...

                    <h3>My first copy/paste assignment (Crossfit,NYC)</h3>
                    <p>One of the things I enjoy is training.
                        For this reason, my first task was to create a Crossfit page.
                        The assignment was to copy the existing page as successfully as possible using my knowledge od Flexbox or Grid.

                    <h3>Saitove mudrolije</h3>
                    <p>Sait is my good friend, who has unique statements or motivations quotes. Each statement came from some funny situation amoung friends.
                        The statements were collected and turned into an application as a gift for his birthday.
                        The idea was that everyone once a day has the opportunity to be enlightened by these funny statements 
                        or just to laugh and wonder. By the way, this is my first, first project.
